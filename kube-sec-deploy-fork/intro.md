# KubeCon Barcelona 2019 Secure Delivery Workshop

As the complexity of cloud architecture increases and the focus shifts more towards security, your organization faces new challenges when managing applications, services, and the cloud infrastructure itself. In particular, how do you ensure that you trust the code that's running in your production environment, that it's vulnerability free, and that it hasn't been tampered with by malicious third parties? You can build automation into your delivery pipelines to ensure that your infrastructure is kept secure against these threats.

In this workshop, you'll set up a simple delivery pipeline using Harbor, configure vulnerability scanning using Clair, and use content trust through Notary and Portieris to be sure that you're pushing the same image to your cluster.

## Getting help

If you're completing the steps at the conference, but outside the slot, the friendly faces at the IBM Cloud booth have contact information for the speakers and can pass on your questions.

If you're not at KubeCon+CloudNativeCon, or you're finishing this workshop after the conference, you can contact the speakers by using the #container-registry channel in the IBM Kubernetes Service Slack.
